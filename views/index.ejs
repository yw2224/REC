        <h1>A study on video recommendation that improves <br> our awareness, understanding and behavior.</h1>
        <p> Current recommender systems are typically trained to promote trendy items and to reinforce users’ historical
            behavior. The quality and variety of the videos we watch are diminished implicitly and greatly. Our goal is
            to find a recommender system that can increase our general wellbeing and the public’s health. </p>

        <h3>Participant consent</h3>
        <p>We are asking you to participate in a research study titled “Intention-aware Recommendation System on
            YouTube”. We will describe this study to you and answer any of your questions. This study is being led by
            Siyu Yao, Yixue Wang, Longqi Yang, Hongyi Wen, Department of Computer Science at Cornell University. The
            Faculty Advisor for this study is Deborah Estrin, Michael Sobolev, Department of Computer Science at Cornell
            University.</p>
        <h4>What you need to do to participate:</h4>
        <p>The whole process will be conducted online. The process includes:<br>
            1. Online surveys with an interval of 3 months in between<br>
            2. Update of YouTube takeout data of your account (downloaded from YouTube takeout website) <br>
            3. Two to three months of continuous emails with our recommended YouTube videos.</p>
        <h4>Risks and discomforts</h4>
        <p>We do not anticipate any risks from participating in this research.</p>
        <h4>Benefits</h4>
        <p>Through this study, we hope to learn more about video recommender systems. Information from this study may
            contribute to better recommendation mechanisms, thus benefit you and other people regarding online content
            consuming experience.</p>
        <h4>Compensation for participation</h4>
        <p>There is a chance of getting a 50-dollar gift card by the end of the study. The probability of getting the
            reward is based on the 'tickets' you gain in the study.
            By uploading your youtube takeout package and fill in the questionnaire, you can get 5 lottery tickets. And
            every time you open an email with our recommended videos, you can get 1 lottery ticket.
        <h4>Privacy/Confidentiality/Data Security</h4>

        <p>• The data collected will only be used for this study, and will be de-identified and anonymized before
            analysis.<br>
            • The data collected will be kept safely, only researchers on this study will have access to it.<br>
            • We anticipate that your participation in this survey presents no greater risk than everyday use of the
            Internet.<br>
            • Please note that email communication is neither private nor secure. Though [I am/we are] taking
            precautions to protect your privacy, you should be aware that information sent through e-mail
            could be read by a third party.<br>
            • De-identified data may exist on backups and server logs beyond the timeframe of this research
            project.<br>
            • Your confidentiality will be kept to the degree permitted by the technology being used. We
            cannot guarantee against interception of data sent via the internet by third parties. <br>
            Sharing De-identified Data Collected in this Research<br>
            De-identified data from this study may be shared with the research community at large to advance science and
            health. We will remove or code any personal information that could identify you before files are shared with
            other researchers to ensure that, by current scientific standards and known methods, no one will be able to
            identify you from the information we share. Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee anonymity of your
            personal data. </p>
        <h4>Taking part is voluntary</h4>
        <p>Your involvement is voluntary, you may refuse to participate before the study begins, discontinue at any
            time, or skip any questions/procedures that may make you feel uncomfortable, with no penalty to you, and no
            effect on the compensation earned before withdrawing, or your academic standing, record, or relationship
            with the university or other organization or service that may be involved with the research.
            During the study, it is required for you to answer all survey or interview questions; meet a minimal
            requirement of entries in a weekly log. You can choose not to participate if you are uncomfortable with
            these conditions.</p>
        <h4>Follow up studies</h4>
        <p>We may contact you again to request your participation in a follow up study. As always, your participation
            will be voluntary and we will ask for your explicit consent to participate in any of the follow up
            studies. </p>

        <h4>If you have questions</h4>
        <p>The main researcher conducting this study are Siyu Yao, Yixue Wang, graduate students at Cornell University.
            Please ask any questions you have now. If you have questions later, you may contact us at sy684@cornell.edu,
